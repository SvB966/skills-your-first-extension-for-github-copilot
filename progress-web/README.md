# Student Progress Tracker

A simple Express + SQLite application for managing students, teachers, courses, and grades.

## Usage

Install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

By default it listens on port `4000`. Basic HTML information is served at `/` and a JSON API is available under `/api/*`.
Open `grades.html` in a browser to visualize grades over the years for each student.

Run tests with:

```bash
npm test
```
